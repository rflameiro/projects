        "Analogous to the irreducible error, the Bayes error rate (BER) is the lowest possible error rate (which is 1 - accuracy) any classifier can achieve on a fixed probability distribution. If the BER is non-zero, as it usually is, then the two classes overlap, and the best possible model will still make a few wrong predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the bit about the \"fixed probability distribution\" is particularly relevant for cheminformatics, because as novel molecules are developed, the \"distribution\" that generated the samples changes, and the BER will likely change as well (it will probably increase).\n",

Yeah, this paper is more \"theory heavy\" than what I'm used to reading and I do not claim to fully understand its limitations. It seems to require >1000 samples to achieve a stable prediction of the error rate. The paper discusses classification problems with simulated datasets of up to 100 dimensions and states that\n",

        "\n",
        "In [Evaluating Bayes Error Estimators on Real-World Datasets with FeeBee](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13034.pdf), the authors propose FeeBee, a framework for analyzing and comparing BER estimators on real-world datasets with unknown probability distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The idea of this work is to evaluate BER estimators by injecting \"label noise\" to existing datasets and estimating the corresponding BER on different noise levels to measure to what degree a BER estimator under/overestimates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some highlights:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The BER estimators evauated calculate a lower and an upper estimate for the BER of the datasets (not a single value). LD(m) and UD(m) are the scores for the estimates of the lower and upper limits for each estimator.\n",
        "\n",
        "- ne claim of this work is that any method that provides a lower-bound estimate for BER that is lower than the known state-of-the-art for a dataset is \"clearly wrong\". This might not be the case, since \"overfitting the test set\" is a known issue, especially for models trained on widely used benchmarks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The authors also show examples in which they apply feature transformation techniques to some of the datasets, although admitting that this might increase the BER.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Using the complete FeeBee framework to compare the performance of the estimators was a bit challenging to me, especially because the authors only considered image and text datasets, the code is formatted to be run using `slurm` and the notebook to analyze the results seems a bit convoluted. It also seems to require the value of the state-of-the-art for the dataset. However, the authors do comment that:\n",
        "\n",
        "> For LD(m) we observe that 1NN, kNN, kNN-LOO and GHP are consistently outperforming all the other methods, with either kNN or kNN-LOO being the best choice on each dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "> For UD(m), we see that there is no method that consistently outperforms the others. Out of the well-performing methods on LD(m), 1NN and GHP are tangibly inferior to kNN and kNN-LOO\n",
        "\n",
        "> kNN and kNN-LOO seem to perform reasonably for determining both the upper and lower limits of BER.\n",
        "\n",
        "> BER estimators are often performing better on a certain type of feature transformations, e.g., 1NN and kNN perform better on pre-trained embeddings, whereas kNN-Extrapolate performs best under transformations that reduce the dimension, such as a low-dimensional PCA.\n",
        "\n",
        "> GHP and 1NN are consistently outperforming the other lower bound estimators whilst enabling easy hyperparameter selection on a single point estimate. We also observe that currently there does not exist an estimator that is able to simultaneously outperform other estimators on both lower and upper bounds.\n",
        "\n",
        "From this discussion, the kNN and GHP estimators seem to be reasonable choices to estimate the upper and lower bounds of the BER. Therefore, I have adapted the code for these methods to run on Colab (I also added the possibility to use Tanimoto as the distance metric in kNN).\n",

        "\n",
        "The method consists in adding random error to every measurement, based on the expected standard deviation, then calculating the correlation coefficient on the \"Simulated x Experimental\" values.

        "The method, which was shown to outperform classical methods for estimating the BER, uses a majority vote classifier, which outputs the most likely class according to the votes of multiple individual classifiers. However, it relies on classifiers that can reasonably approximate *a posteriori* class probabilities, which requires using ensembles of feed-forward neural networks (universal approximators that can generate class probabilities).\n",

For instance, if a classifier predicts the labels of two samples as 0.01 and 0.3, we might classify both as belonging to class 0, but claim that the model is more certain about the first prediction (closer to 0).\n",

However, they cite two works that involve datasets with hard labels, which are those that I have discussed (Learning to Benckmark and FeeBee)."
